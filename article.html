                    </header>
                    <p>The Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering (FASE) Professional Experience Year (PEY) program
                        was in need of a major overhaul, until this year. Numerous issues, including a forced financial
                        structure, outdated workshops, and a lack of diverse job options, were acting as an unintended
                        barrier to students searching for professional development options. A plan was proposed in 2017
                        to rework the program to make it more student friendly.

                    <p>
                        Finally, on October 5th, 2020, after months of consultation with the Engineering Society&apos;s
                        representatives as well as other relevant stakeholders, this new plan finally saw a concrete
                        structure. The FASE Council Executive Committee, led by Vice Dean Undergraduate Tom Coyle, put
                        forward a report for the replacement of the PEY program with a Professional Experience Co-op
                        (PEC) program. This report was passed as a motion at the Faculty Council meeting on October 23,
                        2020 to nearly unanimous approval.

                        However, it almost instantly faced widespread backlash from the greater student body, with many
                        calling the new program a “scam” and a “cash grab” by the faculty. The EngSoc representatives
                        were the primary targets of this dissent, culminating in the near recall of multiple EngSoc
                        Officers at the Annual Accountability Meeting (for details, read “No Officers Recalled”). But
                        how did we end up in this scenario after numerous consultation events and a general positive
                        outlook from the community? Let&apos;s find out.

                        For several years, stakeholders have expressed the need for improvements to the PEY Internship
                        experience. Students demanded better and more customized employment services. Employers advised
                        that students needed to be better prepared to compete for co-op jobs. Staffing structure to
                        reflect student needs, better professional development events, and resume and interview support
                        were areas the Engineering Career Centre (ECC) was falling behind compared to rival universities
                        and they did not make up for that in employer relations. Often there were no incentives for the
                        employer to hire a UofT student, students were not supported when negotiating with potential
                        employers and any failure was blamed directly on the student. Furthermore, there was next to no
                        support for the Engineering Summer Internship Program (ESIP), students who switched jobs
                        mid-PEY, and students who went through the hassle themselves to complete multiple placements or
                        terms.
